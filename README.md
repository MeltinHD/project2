Scenarios: <br />
Scenario 1: Bob books a reservation online <br />
Bob wants to make a reservation at this brand new restaurant with a couple of his friends. In order for him to make a reservation, he would need to register an account in the system by providing his name, email and password. After the input meets the system requirements, it will send Bob a confirmation email. After Bob clicks that link, he is ready to make a reservation. In order to make a reservation, he would need to pick a date and time that is available in the system, and provide the number of guests. After confirming the following information, Bob is able to make any edit or changes if needed. <br />

Scenario 2: Tim managing restaurant reservations <br />
Tim wants to manage the restaurant reservations that are coming in. In order for him to manage them, he would need to log in to the system and go to the reservation management page. Whenever a reservation has been made, Tim should be able to update and manage the availability of tables for that specific date and time. To make life easier for Tim, he wants to receive notifications when a customer makes a reservation. <br />

Documentation: <br />
During the process of this project development, there has been a lot of stress while completing this project, but there have been some lessons that I learned that I need to adapt to my future work. Some of the stress that I was dealing with during this project was to compose the project as a Docker Container. The error I kept on getting was that the database port was already in use which was unable to make my program run. This took me a bit of time to solve this problem. Another reason why I was stressed out during the project was because I started to work on this late, due to other assignments from other courses. To resolve this issue, I should have definitely started earlier. Another issue I had was dealing with the database and html, I had trouble getting inputs from the html form and inserting it into the database, then I had trouble displaying data from the database to html. I solved this issue by researching and watching videos. This is where I was mainly stuck, but in the future, I think I am able to handle it now. This project assignment prepares me for any future assignments as it taught me a lot on coding, and mainly work habits. <br />
